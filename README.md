<h1>üñ•Ô∏è Active Directory Home Lab</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
The Active Directory Home lab consists of installing Windows Server 2016 and Windows 10 operating systems on a virtual machine through VirtualBox to explore Active Directory and its functionalities. Along with installing these from scratch, I will create users to simulate a company environment and the day-to-day tasks an IT person may encounter. <br />


<h2>Utilities Used</h2>

- <b>Windows 2016 Server</b> 
- <b>Windows 10 Operating System </b>
- <b>VirtualBox</b>

<h2>Enviroments Used</h2>

- <b>Windows 2016 Server</b>
- <b>Windows 10 Operating System </b>

After installation of Windows 2019 server on a VM, I am installing Active Directory tools through Server Manager: <br/>

After installing Active Directory, I am able to create a new user. This new user is called helpdesk and will have the same abilities as an administrator would have. To create this user, I am going to copy the administrator user and rename that user to helpdesk. To confirm the copy was done correctly, I will do a side-by-side comparison of the administrator and helpdesk properties <br/>

<br />
<br />
Upon creating the new user helpdesk account in the homelab.local domain, I created another VM that has the Windows 10 operating system. In order for the helpdesk user account to have Active Directory without logging into the administrator command, I am going to install the RSAT tools into the helpdesk account. RSAT tools will allow the same functionalities as Active Directory in the administrator account.<br/>

<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, the RSAT tools are being installed, I went ahead and changed the computer name to a more recognizable name. To connect with the Windows 2016 server, I have to configure the TCP/IPv4 properties manually. AS a result, I assigned the virtual machine an IP address. After assigning the VM an IP address, I configured it to use the DNS server address of the Windows 2016 server. This will allow the VM to have communication with the server and vice versa .<br/>
