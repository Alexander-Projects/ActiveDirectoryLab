After installing Active Directory, I am able to create a new user. This new user is called helpdesk and will have the same abilities as an administrator would have. To create this user, I am going to copy the administrator user and rename that user to helpdesk. To confirm the copy was done correctly, I will do a side-by-side comparison of the administrator and helpdesk properties <br/>
